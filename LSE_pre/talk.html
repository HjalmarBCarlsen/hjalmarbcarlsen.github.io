STRESS!!! Through out my studies I have worked with
textual material and analysis:::

### Text Analysis
1. Controversy Analysis - mapping and document analysis
2. Semantic network analysis for detecting conflict and change
3. Qualitative interpretation(Library Ethnography) and automated text categorization

I think this is a very interesting but also
challenge methodological problem.

In this picture from september 2015 we see
refugee walking on the highway many of them
try to come to sweden to apply for asylum.

This and other pictures where all over the danish
press and every citizens toke action. They travel
food, transport to sweden. Many of them coordinated
their action through grass root groups on Facebook,
most of which for quiet a while had been engaged with
the refugee issue. This collection of mostely grassroote,
what we call the refugee solidarity movement,
group mobilized on Facebook is the object of study.

# Puzzle
## Why the lack of Contention?

???
- give an introduction to the danish setting,
- immergration/integration has been the major political issue for the last many years,
the right party The Danish People Party have gone from 12 procent of the vote in last
many election from 2001-2011, to in 2015 to be the second largest party with 21 procent of the votes.
- The danish people party biggest ideological victory is that they have nearly made immigration a consensus issue in
danish politics. All major parties to a larger or smaller extent has started to immitate the rhetorics and the politics of the danish people party.
- At the same time you large part of the danish population who see themselves and denmark as place of great openness, great respect for human
rights and international conventions and international responsibility. Historically the nation which gave most to international aid per capita
- So the puzzle is this in a situation of major mobilization, where the political parties are becoming more hostil to immigration and muslim
parts of the population giving no major established political platform to articulate their critique, in highly politized and immigrant hostil environment, a movement of like minded
mobilizing on facebook, why is it the frienly style that takes off and becomes the defining feature of this wave of activisme?

### Activity procentage by political block and gender
<img src="gender_politics.svg" height="400" width="700">

???
The movement is highly overrepresented activity from the left side of
the political spectrum. Together with graph over the movements growth
one could read the development as one of a rising distaticefation with
the political parties rhetorics and policies against refugees and
immigrants. Then one could see this movement
as yet anouther illustration of polirized political
climate. But if we read what is going on inside thead
the groups where is nearly no contention. So in order
to find out what these numbers are expressive of we need
to enrich our activity data with text data.

And the best way to do this in many settings,
I'll to why in the end, is not to jump strieght
into quantitative text analysis, but start with
qualitative text analyis.

### Membership inflow and outflow over time
<img src="outflow_inflow.svg" height="400" width="700">

???

Yet the inflow and outflow of member in
these facebook groups and even more
so in other settings greates a rather
unstable environment to do qualitative analysis.
One central way of learning in qualitative analysis
is learning from the authors you read, but if your
informants contantly change this becomes very hard.
So in the present different ways of mobilization
change the setting completely both the tone and
the content of communication changed, but also
to the point where I felt as if this setting
has become a-social, just random people writing
something random before leaving for good.

In this respect this survivale graph on the different cohort
provides som comfort. The longer you have been active
the more chances there is staying active. The graph
also tells something else namely that where is something
special about cohort 2, these are the people that mobilized
before the election periode and many of them are a part
of the so called friendly dwellers or the friendly people.

### Interpretating Social Media Data

### A processual methodology for digital data

1. Formation
2. Process/Narrative
3. Meaning-making and action in Situations

???
1) By focusing on the formation of culture, of interaction order, group
norms and practices, instead of assuming them then the thin, fragmented,
elusive, ephemoral  characher of social media data suddenly becomes a
wellcome feature, because is precisly gives us many different ways to
explore when, where, doing what and how with whom things come to gain a
specific definitive form and endure.

2) This entails an investigation of the process or narrative has lead to
and continuely leads to the reoccurance of the phenomenon of interests.
And of course all those things which challenge the stabilization of the
phenomenon of interest.

3) These processes are made op of meaning making in situations that have certian consequences
for process under study. The reason why this is good for Social Media Data is that
is gives us minimal meaingfull unite of analysis from which the formation of traditional objects of
inqury can be studied. Now there are three relevant ways of understanding the situation,

one is as the conversation and the actors utterance within this, as conversation analysist would
two is as a problematique state of affairs which an talks to
three is the present others whose presences the speaker has a moral obligation towards, in other
words the audience and their assumed experience.

If we don't have a sense of these different aspects of the situation then we can't understand
what a statement means and what it is trying to do.

## Data potentials

1. Cheap, relational, time-stamped, traceble data on social action
2. intersituational variation and variation over time
3. Narrative accounts
4. Close integretion with Quantitative Analysis

???

Cheap, relational and time-stamped on social action

can be used to gather data on axis of variation important for intepretation but are very time consuming,
namely what Tavory and Timmerman in their BOOK ABDUCTIVE ANALYSIS call intersituational variation
and variation over time.

For my argument in the phd this is very important, in that I claim that it was
the stabilization of a certian friendly positive group style that hindered
contentious, critique politization and not that people simply did not engage in political matters, or did
do so on Facebook aso.

### Computationally Grounded Theory

### Pattern discovery | Pattern refinement | Pattern confirmation

*Laura Nelson 2017*

???
For these reasons and more an approach to categorising textual data which has recently been called computationally grounded theory has had quiet som succes
in the major social science journals.The article by Laura Nelson called "Computational Grounded Theory" most plainly and naively articulates
the ambitions of this mode of inquiry, which to derive meaning through co-occuring words, work both formally and interpretatively in the effort
to measure meaning.

She divides op into pattern discovery, pattern refinement and pattern confirmation.

**Pattern discovery**

The role of computer assisted text analysis in pattern discovery is to reduce the messy complicated text into a simpler more interpretable list or network of words(Nelson 2017: 9). This allows for relevant categories to emerge from the data that the researcher due to their own preconceptions or the complexity of the text had not considered. Thereby inducing the researchers biases into the material. The simpler representation are then interpreted and categorized in a fashion similar to normal content analysis, but unlike human-coded text this process is "fully and immediately reproducible"[@nelson2017computational: 13]. In sum computer-assisted pattern discovery that uses actual frequencies of word (co-)occurrence to locate ideas or concepts in the data constitutes a more "reproducible and scientifically valid grounded theory"[@nelson2017computational: 13].

**pattern refinement**
In the pattern refinement step the researcher performances, what Nelson calls, a computationally guided deep reading. This step is suppose to 1) confirm the plausibility, 2) add interpretation and 3) possibly modify the patterns in order to fit better a holistic reading. There are two problems the computational guidance is suppose to solve. One is the natural limits to scale deep reading and secondly our  biased reading. Both these concerns are handled by the algorithms that identify texts "that are representative of a particular theme" and that can "calculate the relative prevalence of that category"(Nelson 2017:24). A careful application of these algorithms enable the research to ""read" and interpret any amount of text without the burden of reading the whole text". Furthermore both the researcher and the research community can "trust that then a quote is chosen as an example of something, it is not an outlier but is indeed representative of some theme in the text"(Nelson 2017:24).

**pattern confirmation**

Seeks to validate the measure with other means. Either a different varibale indicating the same concept, construct validity, or
an event which should activate the category, predictive validity aso.

class: center, middle
<img src="steps.png" alt="" height="600" width="700">
???
Here is a cartoon version of the process.

1) you have a brunch of text,

2) you let some kind of computational process find pattern in the material, weather it is simple word counts, networks of co-occuring words or
topic models

3) these pattern are in turn interpreted by the analysist as either being a *usefull* and meaningfull difference in the data or
not. If not the analysist changes what is called the preprocessing of the textual material, tries to remove some words, defining the
window differently(the length of a word spell wherein a word can be said to co-occure with another), in network analysis we might
say something like words have to co-occure 4 times before their relations count or I need to scale the network differently, use another
spacialization algorithm aso. This untill they make meaningfull results which the analysist can understand and lable

But by what warrant are making all these decision and interpretations? How do they relate to the experience of the actors whos
symbolic interaction we categorising? The main validity creteria one hears is that the model or network visualization has to
be interpretable or usefull as it is said again and again. But the data is not there to make sense to us, we are here to make
sense of the data. One might then say if we assume that symbolic interaction has some kind of order and meaning to it then
we most be able to find it with these methods. But here we most remember that we are working on a rather unstable indicator or the actual phenomenon
and not the phenomenon itself. We are taking statements located, delinated and related in specific ways and cutting them
into discrete words which then use to make inference about the originale statements.

This points towards the future problem of operating on words alone, in that they do not in any obvious way tame interpretation,
they are multiple, ambigious in their natur that is why we can use the same word in many different statements. Anyone who has
looked at a network of words has had the feeling that this could mean anything and nothing. Only when you have clear ideas of
what is in network does can it speak to you clearly. It is in this sense highly dependent upon the researchers own frame of reference.

But I'm going to quick here becuase computationally grounded approach also reads whole documents engages with deep reading.
hence the manipulations and interpretations of words can be justified with reference to the deep reading of documents.
There is a very practical reason why does not work, and it is that with large possibly correct manipulations one would quickly
have to read impratical many document. The other is that the current sampling procedures for interpreting what a cluster is about
relies on a very naive sampling - in Topic Modeling one reads the most predictive documents of given cluster, and in typically network
approach one makes a similiar move reading the documents or web pages most connected within the cluster. These strategies area
clearly not simple random sampling of any sort but rather what one might call paradigmatic sampling, where one gets the
exemplar that tells us something about the rest of the cluster is about. But with paradigmatic sampling or case selection we most
trust that the general category of which a document is an exemplar is an interpretatively valid category or else the procedure makes
no sense. But the category is itself derived from words relations so it can't be used to justify how these are made.

Of course one might say that I'm confusing the context of discovery with the context of justification. In the last step the pattern confirmation
step we validate the cateogries that we have found with classical validation measures. But the current validation procedures
in topic modeling for example does not ensure us against measurement error and provide proff of interpretative validity of
the category. There is a simple reason for this and that is that they do not test weather what they think is in a given
cluster is actually in the cluster, they to have a manually codede test through which they see how their own interpretation
alignes with the model. Futhermore even if we implimented a procedure of where one would validate ones model with a test set
as is normal practice in supervised machine learning, we only some of the way. Both because we can't out of the box trust human
interpretation, we only do so after carefull interpretative work which invovles a great deal of learning and reflexivity.
But also in making a test set we have to make many decisions that can influence our finale results and which have little and
no reference to experience.

### What could possibly go wrong?

<img src="reponsiveness_research_question.svg" alt="" height="600" width="600">

???
We have working paper where we try to show the consequence of the lack of validation procedures, and
how easily one can end op with topic model which categories seem sensical from the reading most predictive works
and most predictive documents. So what I have talk about alot until now is interpretative validity, now I'll
go more into the related problem of measurement error and baises.

We'll also change empirical setting abit. So now we are not dealing with Refugee solidarity actvist but what topics danish political
parties/politicians write about on thier facebook. So what we interested in besides this simulation test of topic model,
is how much the refugee issue dominates the issuescape through time and what role 'likes' play for the allocation
of attention amoungst politicians. Thier opputurism or responsiveness if you will. It is the latter the simulations ask to.

In order to illustrate the consequences of the measurement issues in Topic modeling we simulated alot of topic modeling research
project, from the acceptance of cluster representing a certian topic, to labling the topic and in the last instance using that
input into a model that answers which parties are oppertunistic and which are not. That is which parties aligne their attention
allocation to topic with the amounts of likes they get.

So I'll quickly run over the procedure:

1) constructed a dataset based on dictionary lables that is words that are highly indicative of a topic,
where each Facebook post only had one label. With some certainty we could then say that this post was mainly about
a certian topic. In the end we where left with a dataset of 46209 documents ranging over 15 different topics.

2) we then ran a LDA topic models with a different number of clusters from 15-30 and ran it a 100 time for each setting
this resulted in 1600 different topic models and 36000 different topic candidates(that categorisations of the data).

3) This the topic candidate had many of the words and documents associated with a given topic we would lable is as being that
topic. after this we where left with 3000 topics that matched our prior conception on what a topic was. With these 3000 topic
candidates we can then compare their precision, that is how many of the those documents that the model and we think are about
a given topic is about that topic.
---
class: center, middle
<img src="precision_topic_mode.svg" alt="" height="700" width="700">

???

And that is what we did here. And this is a very worrying result, because the topic candidates that we with current
procedures have no have choicing between have very very different precision scores. The median being 63 meaning that 50 procent
chance of choicing a topic cluster that has a lower than 63 procent accuracy.

One might say that this is not that big of a problem if the lack of accuracy is randomly distributed(an highly unlighly scenario),
but lets see.

---

class: center, middle
<img src="precision_across_topics.svg" alt="" height="700" width="700">

???
So here we have precision across topics. And it is obvious that the topic model does not threat all Topics equally
leading to differential bias. If it did there would be no difference in the box plot above. So the topic model is very bad
at measuring elder care, and much better at measuring education.

This is of course very problematique in that you will systematically be better as measuring some topic rather then others.

---
class: center, middle
<img src="differential_bias.svg" alt="" height="700" width="700">

This differential baise is also true across different political parties.
Finally for each plausible choice of topics we assess a separate precision score for each party. We then transform each precision score to a standardized distance from the precision norm of the plausible topic. The distribution for each party is reported in figure 4. It shows that the bias is distributed very unevenly across party lines suggesting that comparisons across background characteristics can be highly problematic. In the supplementary material we investigate how the number of training examples for each topic and party could be part of the cause.

If we had no problem everthing would be at zero where.
